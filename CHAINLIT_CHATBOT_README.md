## üéØ What the Chatbot Does

The CalcMate chatbot provides a complete mathematical reasoning system that:

- **üîç Retrieves Similar Problems**: Finds mathematically similar problems from the knowledge base
- **üìò Extracts Equations**: Converts natural language to mathematical equations
- **üßÆ Solves Symbolically**: Uses SymPy for exact mathematical solutions
- **ü§ñ Reasons with LLM**: Uses CTransformers (Llama-2-7B) for complex reasoning
- **‚úÖ Verifies Solutions**: Checks solutions against original equations
- **üìä Tracks Statistics**: Monitors your session performance

## üí¨ Available Commands

| Command     | Description                                  |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `/help`     | Show help information and available commands |
| `/stats`    | Display your session statistics              |
| `/examples` | Show example problems to try                 |

## üìù Example Questions

### Algebra Problems

- "Two numbers sum to 50 and their difference is 10. What are the numbers?"
- "A number is 5 more than twice another number. If their sum is 35, what are the numbers?"

### Speed/Distance/Time

- "A car travels 120 km in 2 hours. What is its speed?"
- "A train travels at 60 km/h. How far does it travel in 2.5 hours?"

### Cost/Price Calculations

- "If a pizza costs $18 and you order 3 pizzas, what's the total cost?"
- "A store offers 20% discount on a $50 item. What's the final price?"

### Geometry

- "A rectangle has length 12 cm and width 8 cm. What is its area?"
- "A circle has radius 7 cm. What is its circumference?"

### Complex Word Problems

- "A train leaves station A at 9 AM traveling at 60 km/h. Another train leaves station B at 10 AM traveling at 80 km/h. If the stations are 300 km apart, when will they meet?"
